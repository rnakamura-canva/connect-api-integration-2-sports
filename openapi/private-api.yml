        Brand templates were migrated to use a new ID format in September 2025. If your integration stores brand template IDs, you'll need to migrate to use the new IDs. Old brand template IDs will continue to be accepted for 6 months to give you time to migrate to the new IDs.

        </Warning>

        <Note>

        To use this API, your integration must act on behalf of a user that's a member of a [Canva Enterprise](https://www.canva.com/enterprise/) organization.

        </Note>

        Starts a new [asynchronous job](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-requests-responses/#asynchronous-job-endpoints) to autofill a Canva design using a brand template and input data.

        To get a list of input data fields, use the [Get brand template dataset
        API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/brand-templates/get-brand-template-dataset/).

        Available data field types to autofill include:

        - Images
        - Text
        - Charts

          WARNING: Chart data fields are a [preview feature](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/#preview-apis). There might be unannounced breaking changes to this feature which won't produce a new API version.

        </Warning>

        The Keys API (`connect/keys`) is a security measure you can use to verify the authenticity
        of webhooks you receive from Canva Connect. The Keys API returns a
        [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517#section-2), which you can use to
        decrypt the webhook signature and verify it came from Canva and not a potentially malicious
        actor. This helps to protect your systems from
        [Replay attacks](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/).

        The keys returned by the Keys API can rotate. We recommend you cache the keys you receive
        from this API where possible, and only access this API when you receive a webhook signed
        with an unrecognized key. This allows you to verify webhooks quicker than accessing this API
        every time you receive a webhook.

        Creates a new Canva design. To create a new design, you can either:

        - Use a preset design type.
        - Set height and width dimensions for a custom design.

        Additionally, you can also provide the `asset_id` of an asset in the user's [projects](https://www.canva.com/help/find-designs-and-folders/) to add to the new design. Currently, this only supports image assets. To list the assets in a folder in the user's projects, use the [List folder items API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/folders/list-folder-items/).

        NOTE: Blank designs created with this API are automatically deleted if they're not edited within 7 days. These blank designs bypass the user's Canva trash and are permanently deleted.

        Starts a new [asynchronous job](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-requests-responses/#asynchronous-job-endpoints) to import an external file as a new design in Canva.

        The request format for this endpoint has an `application/octet-stream` body of bytes,
        and the information about the import is provided using an `Import-Metadata` header.

        Supported file types for imports are listed in [Design imports overview](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/design-imports/#supported-file-types).

        <Note>

        For more information on the workflow for using asynchronous jobs, see [API requests and responses](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-requests-responses/#asynchronous-job-endpoints). You can check the status and get the results of design import jobs created with this API using the [Get design import job API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/design-imports/get-design-import-job/).

        This endpoint implements the OAuth 2.0 `token` endpoint, as part of the Authorization Code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). For more information, see [Authentication](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/authentication/).

        To generate an access token, you must provide one of the following:

        - An authorization code
        - A refresh token

        Generating a token using either an authorization code or a refresh token allows your integration to act on behalf of a user. You must first [obtain user authorization and get an authorization code](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/authentication/#obtain-user-authorization).

        Access tokens may be up to 4 KB in size, and are only valid for a specified period of time. The expiry time (currently 4 hours) is shown in the endpoint response and is subject to change.

        **Endpoint authentication**

        Requests to this endpoint require authentication with your client ID and client secret, using _one_ of the following methods:

        - **Basic access authentication** (Recommended): For [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), the `{credentials}` string must be a Base64 encoded value of `{client id}:{client secret}`.
        - **Body parameters**: Provide your integration's credentials using the `client_id` and `client_secret` body parameters.

        This endpoint can't be called from a user's web-browser client because it uses client authentication with client secrets. Requests must come from your integration's backend, otherwise they'll be blocked by Canva's [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) policy.

        **Generate an access token using an authorization code**

        To generate an access token with an authorization code, you must:

        - Set `grant_type` to `authorization_code`.
        - Provide the `code_verifier` value that you generated when creating the user authorization URL.
        - Provide the authorization code you received after the user authorized the integration.

        **Generate an access token using a refresh token**

        Using the `refresh_token` value from a previous user token request, you can get a new access token with the same or smaller scope as the previous one, but with a refreshed expiry time. You will also receive a new refresh token that you can use to refresh the access token again.

        To refresh an existing access token, you must:

        - Set `grant_type` to `refresh_token`.
        - Provide the `refresh_token` from a previous token request.

        - The user's consent for your integration is also revoked. This means that the user must go through the OAuth process again to use your integration.

        <Note>

        To use this API, your integration must act on behalf of a user that's on a Canva plan with premium features (such as Canva Pro).

        </Note>

        Starts a new [asynchronous job](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-requests-responses/#asynchronous-job-endpoints)
        to create a resized copy of a design. The new resized design is
        added to the top level of the user's
        [projects](https://www.canva.com/help/find-designs-and-folders/) (`root` folder).

        To resize a design into a new design, you can either:

          - Use a preset design type.
          - Set height and width dimensions for a custom design.

        Note the following behaviors and restrictions when resizing designs:
        - Designs can be resized to a maximum area of 25,000,000 pixels squared.
        - Resizing designs using the Connect API always creates a new design. In-place resizing is currently not available in the Connect API, but can be done in the Canva UI.
        - Resizing a multi-page design results in all pages of the design being resized. Resizing a section of a design is only available in the Canva UI.
        - [Canva docs](https://www.canva.com/create/documents/) can't be resized, and other design types can't be resized to a Canva doc.
        - Canva Code designs can't be resized, and other design types can't be resized to a Canva Code design.

        <Note>
        For more information on the workflow for using asynchronous jobs,
        see [API requests and responses](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-requests-responses/#asynchronous-job-endpoints).
        You can check the status and get the results of resize jobs created with this API using the
